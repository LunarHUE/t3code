# Settings and project overrides

On web and desktop, the "Applying settings for …" sentence at the top of Settings pages picks
the project and environment a change applies to. Pages that only hold device preferences, such as
Appearance, don't show it. They start at **All projects** and **All environments**
and stay selected as you move between categories or search for a setting.

Preferences saved on this device, such as appearance, confirmations and browser profiles, always
show and ignore the selection. Everything else is stored on a server. Choose one environment to
edit its settings, or leave **All environments** to edit every connected environment at once.
Offline environments keep their current values; this is a bulk edit, not a synced global default.

Choose a project to override settings for it on the selected environments. A layers icon beside
each server row's title shows where the value comes from: the built-in default, the environment,
or a project override. Click it to see that chain on every selected environment. An override can
be reset to inherit again. Settings that cannot be overridden by a project are shown read-only
while a project is selected.

When the selected environments disagree, the control shows **Mixed** in place of a value and the
layers icon turns amber. Picking a value applies it to every selected environment.

Changing an environment value never touches a project's own override. When projects override the
setting you are editing, the layers icon counts them and the chain lists each one with its value:
click a project to jump to it, or **Reset all** to make those projects follow the environment
again.

Providers and diagnostics are per machine: they show one environment at a time, the primary
one until you pick another. Every other setting fans out to the selection.

On mobile, open **Settings** and use the filter in its header to choose connected environments
and a project. The filter stays available in server-setting pages. With **All projects** selected,
the **Server settings** categories and auto-settle controls in **Thread behavior** edit the
selected environments' defaults. Choosing a project edits its overrides on the selected
environments. Use **Use defaults** in a page to remove that page's project overrides.
Open **Settings → Projects & threads → Overview** to rename the project across its selected
connected checkouts and see where those checkouts live.
Settings that are environment-wide stay read-only while a project is selected. When selected
targets disagree, a control shows **Mixed** until you choose one value. Appearance, keyboard,
and other phone-only settings ignore the filter.

## Worktree branch names

In **Settings → Source Control → Worktree branch naming**, choose a static prefix,
a model-selected semantic prefix such as `feat/` or `fix/`, or custom instructions
for the complete name. The static prefix defaults to `t3/`; a trailing slash is
optional, and an empty prefix adds nothing. Invalid characters in a static prefix
are replaced with hyphens. Custom instructions are appended to
the naming prompt and can specify issue IDs, namespaces, and casing.

These settings apply to automatically named new worktree branches. Select a project
to override its environment defaults. Worktree directories keep their original names.
If generation fails, or a custom name is invalid or already taken, the temporary
branch name remains.

## Scheduled tasks on mobile

Open **Settings → Scheduled tasks** to create recurring tasks or manage existing
ones across your connected environments. Use the settings filter to narrow the
list by environment or project. Each task runs on the environment you choose,
using its project, model, and workspace settings. Fixed-time schedules use that
environment's time zone, which may differ from your phone's.

You can edit, pause, resume, run immediately, or delete a task from the list.
Webhook tasks only run when their URL is called, so they can't be run
immediately.
Leaving an edited form asks before discarding unsaved changes.

## Webhook automations

In **Settings → Scheduled tasks**, choose **On webhook**
as a task's schedule to run it whenever another service calls its URL, such as
GitHub on a new pull request or a CI job that failed. A public URL needs a
[T3 Connect](remote-access.md) managed tunnel; after you save the task, copy
its URL from the editor. Without one, the editor shows only the URL's path.
**Rotate** replaces the URL and the old one stops working.

The prompt decides what the agent sees. Placeholders pull values out of the
request: `{{body.path}}` for a JSON or form field, `{{headers.name}}`,
`{{query.name}}`, `{{body}}` for the raw body, and `{{request}}` for everything.
For example, `Review this PR: {{body.pull_request.html_url}}` sends only the
pull request link. A placeholder with no value is left empty.

For GitHub, turn on **Require signature**, keep the header
`x-hub-signature-256`, hex encoding and the `sha256=` prefix, and enter the
same secret in the repository's webhook settings with content type
`application/json`. Requests without a valid signature are rejected. Set this
up on desktop or web; mobile keeps an existing signature check but can't turn
one on.

On desktop and web, pick **Deliveries** from a task's menu to see recent
requests and the prompt each one produced.

If the environment is offline, the sender gets an error and nothing runs;
redeliver from the sender, such as GitHub's **Recent Deliveries**, once it is
back. To have T3 Connect keep requests instead, turn on **Hold webhooks while
offline** in **Settings → Connections**. T3 Connect then stores requests to a
T3 Connect URL for up to 24 hours and delivers them when the environment
returns. Leave it off if you don't want request bodies stored outside your
machine. To skip requests that waited too long, set **Skip requests older
than** on the task.

## Defaults and inheritance

General contains the model and workspace for new threads. Integrations controls agent browser
access. Source Control contains automatic pull, the default pull request merge method and text
generation. The same rows edit environment defaults or project overrides depending on the
project crumb.

The Project category, shown while a project is selected, holds the project's name, icon, actions,
checkouts and removal. A project's `t3.json` actions can be imported there.

Settings a repository can also declare in `t3.json`, such as the workspace for new threads,
resolve in one order: a project override, then the environment setting, then `t3.json`, then the
built-in default. Leave a setting on **Inherit** to let the next tier decide.
Browser access changes apply when an agent session next starts.

New worktrees initialize git submodules recursively. If that step is slow because the repository
declares many nested submodules, set **Submodules** in **Settings → General** (with the project
selected to override it there) to **Top level only** to stop at the ones the repository declares
itself, or **Skip** to leave them for a setup script. It resolves in the same order as the
workspace default: a `"worktreeSubmodules"` value in the `t3.json` of the branch being checked out
applies when the project and environment are both on **Inherit**.

## Global actions and templates

Global actions are saved on this device and appear beside project actions in every environment.
Command actions run in a terminal on the project's environment. URL actions open on your device,
so editor links reach your locally installed editor. URL actions accept only `vscode:`,
`vscode-insiders:`, `cursor:`, `http:`, and `https:` links, including actions imported from a repository.

An action can use `{{project.name}}`, `{{project.root}}`, `{{project.id}}`,
`{{environment.label}}`, and `{{environment.id}}`. Values are resolved when you run it.
URL substitutions are percent-encoded; command substitutions are shell-quoted.
An unknown variable shows an error and prevents the action from running.
Command templates support POSIX shells and PowerShell. Place variables in ordinary arguments,
either unquoted or inside single or double quotes. Templates using shell substitutions, special
quoting, heredocs, or comments are refused; put complex logic in a script and pass variables as
arguments. Command variable values cannot contain terminal control characters.

Add project variables in the project's action settings, such as `sshName`, and refer to them as
`{{project.sshName}}`. A project variable can override a built-in project value such as `name`.
Environment variables use `{{env.sshName}}`; device-specific environment overrides take precedence
over the defaults advertised by that environment's server.

For example, define a URL action once:

```text
vscode://vscode-remote/ssh-remote+{{project.name}}.{{env.sshName}}.repos/workspace?windowId=_blank
```

With project name `abstract` and environment variable `sshName` set to `dev1`, this opens
`abstract.dev1.repos`. To use a different alias for one project, override its `name` action variable,
or override that action and use `{{project.sshName}}` instead.

Servers advertise variables whose names begin with `T3CODE_ENV_`. Remove the prefix, lowercase the
suffix, then camel-case underscore-separated words: `T3CODE_ENV_REPO_HOST` becomes `env.repoHost`
and `T3CODE_ENV_SSH_NAME` becomes `env.sshName`. `T3CODE_ENV_SSHNAME` is also accepted as `env.sshName`.
These values are visible to connected clients; use them for aliases and paths, not secrets.

A project action with the same ID replaces the global action in that project. You can also hide
a global action for a project. Action settings show these overrides and hidden actions;
**Reset to global** removes the project replacement and makes the global action visible again.

## Worktree location

New worktrees go in the `worktrees` folder of the T3 home directory. To put them somewhere else,
such as another drive, set **Settings → Storage → Worktree location** to an absolute path like
`D:\worktrees` or `~/worktrees`. The setting is per machine. Existing worktrees stay where they
are, and cleanup covers both the default folder and the custom one.

## Storage cleanup

Open **Settings → Storage** to enable automatic cleanup on one machine or all connected
environments. Policies are off by default and run on the server at startup, when changed, and
hourly. Offline machines keep their existing policies.

Select a project to set **Automatic worktree cleanup** to **Inherit**, **Off**, or **Custom**.
Inherit follows each machine's rules; Off keeps that project's worktrees until you remove them
manually. Custom applies separate worktree rules to the selected project or checkout. Browser
captures and log retention remain machine-wide.

Worktrees can be removed after a chosen number of inactive days, after merging, or when they
have no commits beyond the default branch. Only T3-managed worktrees are eligible. Active
sessions, shared worktrees, uncommitted changes, and ignored files other than `node_modules`
prevent removal. Branches and thread history stay; starting another turn recreates the checkout.
Merge cleanup requires the commits to be included in the remote default branch, so squash merges
may need the inactivity rule instead.

Enable **Delete worktrees with deleted threads** to remove safe worktrees after their last
thread is deleted, including archived threads and worktrees left by earlier deletions. The
server waits for sessions and terminals to stop and retries skipped worktrees after restart.
Existing prompts for deleting a worktree manually remain available when this policy is off.

Browser captures and rotated logs have separate retention periods. Expired capture links stop
working. Current logs, message attachments, and browser profiles are kept.

## Project icons

Select the project and open Project to choose an icon, emoji, monogram, or image. The choice applies to
every checkout in the project group and appears on connected clients. Choose **Automatic** to let
T3 Code detect an icon again.

Choose **Monogram** in the icon picker to set one or two letters or numbers and a color.

When no image is found, web and desktop show a two-character monogram with a color
from the icon palette, derived from the saved project name. For example, `Nebula` becomes `NA`,
`Silver Orchard` becomes `SO`, and `M7 Forge` becomes `M7`.

## Keep the default branch current

In Source Control, enable **Automatically pull** to keep the default-branch checkout up to date
with its configured upstream. Choose an environment to set the default or a project to override it.
On mobile, use **Settings → Source control** to change selected environment defaults or project overrides.

T3 Code only pulls when it can fast-forward and the checkout has no changed files, untracked files,
or local commits. It skips checkouts on another branch or without an upstream. If a checkout has
local work, resolve it yourself before automatic pulls can resume.
